# Your project name ✨
This is the back-end section of my project. My whole project is a full stack website about ornithology (study of birds).
This part is the API I'm using in the front-end section. The online database used for this API is on MongoDB. There's a bird and saves collection.
The bird collection has text like a name and description and images like distribution map or an icon. The saves collection contains usernames and level number.
